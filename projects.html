        <a href="https://suryaelavazhagan.github.io/UpdateAttendance/index.html">UpdateAttendance</a>
      </h6>
      <p>
        I was in-charge for maintaining attendance sheet for my class for a semester. I hated paper work. Thus made a little app for updating period-wise attendance of my classmates.
      </p>
      <h6>Problem Solving</h6>
      <p>
        Competitive programming is one of the reasons why I started loving computers. When I was first introduced to online platforms for problem solving,
        I created <a href="https://github.com/SuryaElavazhagan/fictional-octo-tribble">this repo</a>. Here is another <a href="https://github.com/SuryaElavazhagan/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms">repo</a>
        where I solved all the exercises for a course. (Please do use this repo for comparing your solutions).
